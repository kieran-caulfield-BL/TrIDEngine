Here are some samples sources in various languages, to quickly see how
easy is to add some kind of file recognizing capabilities to an
application using the TrIDLib DLL.

Samples in others languages will follow soon. If you happen to have the
time to code a similar demo in a different programming language, feel
free to send it. It will be very appreciated and I'll be glad to include
it on the samples package, giving the proper credits off course.

N.B. To run the code you just need to get a suitable TrIDDefs.TRD filetypes
definitions package from TrID's page (see link above).
